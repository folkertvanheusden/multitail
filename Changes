3.4.9 - compiles again on MacOS X, fixed typo in on-line help

3.5.0 - replaced '-v -e[m]' by '-e[m]' (print if match) and '-ev' (print if not match). that is different from the previous situation: it a regular expression is found while checking the filter which says -e (or -em), output will only be given if the regexp matches with the pattern in the inputbuffer. -ev: only print if the regexp does NOT match. checking of the filters stops when there's a match for either -e[m] or -ev

       - do a read of SSIZE_MAX or 65536 (whichever is smaller) instead of just hardcoded 65535 bytes: that way it'll also run on UNIX systems where SSIZE_MAX < 65535
       - when reading from stdin and the end of the file is reached, multitail would busy-loop causing high cpu load
       - terminal-mode can now also select the subwindow
       - disabled terminal-mode for stdin (as that would not work)

       - statistics screen now also shows the number of colorpairs in use

       - conversion schemes/color schemes selection would fail if no schemes were defined in the config file.
       - on certain terminals one need to explicitly set the background color to be usable

       - replaced 2 strcat()s with strncat()
       - one can now explicitly wether the 'tail' used is a posix only tail (e.g. inotail) or also supports the old "-[0-9]" format
       - MultiTail can now act as a syslog-server (e.g. listening on UDP port 514 for messages). this is usefull when you want to monitor syslog capable devices (UNIX servers, Cisco switches, etc.) without the need for a syslog server
       - made some errors not fatal - e.g. let them give an error popup instead
       - unfiltered redirection would only emit the first line in certain situations
       - fixed a segfault (occuring only on AIX) at exit
