.SH NAME
MultiTail \- browse through several files at once
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "multitail [" options "]
.sp
options:
.BI "[\-cs|\-Cs|\-c\-] [\-s] [\-i] inputfile [\-i anotherinputfile] [...]"
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B MultiTail
lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail program. The difference is that it creates multiple windows on your console (with ncurses). It can also monitor wildcards: if another file matching the wildcard has a more recent modification date, it will automatically switch to that file. That way you can, for example, monitor a complete directory of files. Merging of 2 or even more logfiles is possible. It can also use colors while displaying the logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of what is important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with regular expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can also have windows with the output of shell scripts and other software. When viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the functionality of tools like 'watch' and such. When new mail arrives for the current user, the statuslines will become green. To reset this "mail has arrived"-state, press ' ' (a space). For help at any time, press F1.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-i" file
Select a file to monitor. You can have multiple
.BI "\-i " file
parameters.
You only need to add
.BI "\-i " file
in front of a filename if the filename starts with a dash ('-').
.TP
.B "\-I" file
Same as
.BI "\-i " file
but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).
.TP
.B "-iw" file interval
.B "-Iw" file interval
Like '-i'/'-I' but expects the parameter to be a wildcard and the second(!) an interval.
Initially MultiTail will start monitoring the first file with the most recent modification
time. Every interval it will check if any new files were created (or modified) and start tailing
that one. *Don't forget* to put quotation marks around the filename as otherwhise the shell will
try to substitute them!
.TP
.B "\-l" command
Command to execute in a window. Parameter is the command. Do not forget to use "'s if the external command needs parameter! (e.g. -l "ping host").
.TP
.B "\-L" command
Same as
.BI "\-l"
but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).
.TP
.B "\-j"
Read from stdin (can be used only once as there is only 1 stdin).
.TP
.B "\-J"
Same as
.BI "-j"
but add the output to the previous window (so the output is merged).
.TP
.B "\-\-mergeall"
Merge all of the following files into the same window (see '--no-mergeall').
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-mergeall"
Stop merging all files into one window (see '--mergeall');
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-repeat"
When the same line is repeated, it will be suppressed while printing a "Last message repeated x times" message.
.TP
.B "\-\-mark\-interval x"
Print every 'x' seconds a mark-line when nothing else was printed.
.TP
.B "\-q i path"
Check path for new files with interval 'i', all in new windows. One can enter paths here understood by the shell. E.g. "/tmp/*". Note: do not forget to add quotes around the pathname to prevent the shell from parsing it!
.TP
.B "\-Q i path"
Like -q: but merge them all in one window.
.TP
.B "\-\-new\-only"
For -q/-Q: only create windows for files created after MultiTail was started.
.TP
.B "\-\-closeidle x
Close windows when more then 'x' seconds no new data was processed.
.TP
.B "\-a x"
Write the output also to file 'x' (like 'tee') AFTER it was filtered by MultiTail.
.TP
.B "\-A x"
Write the output also to file 'x' (like 'tee') BEFORE it was filtered by MultiTail.
.TP
.B "-g x"
Send the output also to command 'x' AFTER it was filtered by MultiTail.
.TP
.B "-G x"
Send the output also to command 'x' BEFORE it was filtered by MultiTail.
.TP
.B "\-S"
Prepend merged output with subwindow-number.
.TP
.B "\-t" title
With this switch, "title" is displayed in the statusline instead of the filename or commandline.
.TP
.B "\-n" number_of_lines
Number of lines to tail initially. The default depends on the size of the terminal-window.
.TP
.B "\-N" number_of_lines
Like -n but this parameter will be used for all files/commands you tail after this parameter.
.TP
.B "\-r" interval
Restart the command (started with -l/-L) after it has exited. With interval you can set how long to sleep before restarting.
.TP
.B "\-R" interval
Restarts a command like -r only this one shows the difference in output compared to the previous run.
.TP
.B "\-rc" / "\-Rc" interval
Like \-r / \-R but clears the window before each iteration.
.TP
.B "\-h"
The help.
.TP

.SH KEYS
You can press a couple of keys while the program runs.
To see a list of them, press F1 (or ^h). You can press F1 (or ^h) at any time: it gives you context related information.
Press 'q' to exit the program.

.SH EXAMPLES
See http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/examples.html for more and other examples.
.TP
.B "multitail /var/log/apache/access_log logfile \-i \-filestartingwithdatsh"
This creates three windows. One with the contents of /var/log/apache/access_log, one with the contents of logfile and so on.
.TP
.B "multitail -R 2 -l \(dqnetstat -t\(dq"
This runs netstat every 2 seconds and then shows what has changed since the previous run. That way one can see new connections being made and closed connections fading away.
.TP
.B "multitail logfile \-l \(dqping 192.168.1.3\(dq
This creates two windows. One with the contents of logfile, one with with the output of 'ping 192.168.1.3'.
.TP
.B "multitail /var/log/apache/access_log \-I /var/log/apache/error_log"
This creates
.BI "one"
window with the contents of /var/log/apache/access_log
.BI "merged"
with the contents of /var/log/apache/error_log.
.TP
.B "multitail \-M 0 /var/log/apache/access_log \-I /var/log/apache/error_log"
Same as previous example. This example will store all logged entries in a buffer so that you can later on browse through them (by pressing '
.BI "b"
 ').

.SH BUGS
As this program grew larger and larger over the time with new functionality sometimes added ad-hoc, some bugs may have been introduced. Please notify folkert@vanheusden.com if you find any.
.PP
Well, except for the resizing of your terminal window. The program might
crash when doing such things. Upgrading the ncurses library to at least
version 5.3 might help in that case.
