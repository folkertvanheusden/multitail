Since version 2.8.4 you can automatically send an e-mail
with information of the system you're using. That way I
have some statistics on the usage of MultiTail. It
basically sends the output of 'uname -a'. To invoke all
of this, enter:
make thanks

Is your company using MultiTail and you would like to be
mentioned on http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/usedby.html ?
Then please send me a logo (not too big) and a link and I'll
add it to that page.
